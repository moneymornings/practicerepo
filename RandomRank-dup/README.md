# Random Ranking Game
Our project is a game where you are given five (5) random movie/TV show posters to blindly rank each one from 1 to 5.

Players can choose between the two categories by accessing the navigation bar on the top right corner.
(__Start the game first!__)  
On the start page, players can choose to start the game or meet the developers by clicking on their respected buttons.  
Follow the instructions and have fun!

The technologies we used were HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, a Movie Database API, and a TV Shows Database API.
