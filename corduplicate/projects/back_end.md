# Full Stack Project Requirements

## Description
Your task is to form into teams and build a full-stack application that utilizes the following stack:
* Node
* Express
* Sequelize
* PostgreSQL
* bcrypt

This project will focus more on the back-end content we've been covering, but it should have a great front-end too as this is your Full Stack Project

## Technical Requirements
* Use Express for your backend routes
* Use a Postgres database to persist your application data (*)
* Log all endpint calls and failures with Winston
* Harden each server endpoint
* Your server should serve a website that users can interact with (user actions should trigger CRUD operations) (*)
* Accept User Login and Registration (*)
* Must have a Forgot Password Page
* Document API using Swagger (https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)
* Store Passwords using bcrypt hashes (*)
* Break different parts of the code into different files / modules.
* Deploy your project to Render, Vercel, Heroku, etc(easy mode) or Amazon AWS (hard mode) (*)
* **IMPORTANT:** Include a very detailed README. This is a potential portfolio piece and employers will look at the README first!

**Your project should be a fully functional website. The login and registraion should only be a small component of the actual site. This means that you most likely will have multiple tables.** 

## Workflow Requirements

* Create one github repo (add all group members as collaborators)
* Collaborate using PRs (Pull Requests), making sure to tag a reviewer for approval
* Don't commit anything to the master branch (remote or local)
* Instead, work on a branch of master and merge your work in through Github Pull Requests
* Have other teammates be Reviewers for you pull requests before merging
* Use a feature tracking system for SCRUM, such as Trello or GitHub Projects
* We will meet with each team for "stand up meetings" during classtime
