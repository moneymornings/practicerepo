Welcome to your Front-End Project!

For the next 3 days, you'll be working on a project that demonstrates the skills you've learned thus far by building an interactive front-end project. We'll explore the Agile methodology for developing software at a high level, and help you prepare to collaborate with other developers. You'll learn how to use Github Projects to manage your project and demonstrate some of your new Agile knowledge.

You'll present your Front-End Project to the class in the form of a demo.

Project Management 101
Frontend Group Project Requirements

Learning Objectives

By now, you should have most of the skills necessary to understand much of the world of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The intent with these requirements is for each student in the group to use these skills to learn something new and use it in a "real world" way. Searching for external resources and being able to understand and apply documentation is a big part of software development. Whether it is an API, a new JavaScript library, deployment, testing, etc. Go learn something new and put those web development skills to work!

Another goal of this project is polish / thoroughness. A thorough README.md, deploying to a public web server, thoughtful commit messages, following a PR review process, good code organization, etc are all signals of quality software development. The end result of this project should be a portfolio piece that you are excited to put on your resume and share with friends and family: "Hey - look at this cool thing I built!" Look for opportunities to polish and show the world what you can do!

Project Description

You will be using the front-end skills you have developed throughout the frontend phase:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
APIs
Technical Requirements

Your application must:

Use at least one JavaScript library. Examples:

Moment.js
Marked
jQuery UI
chessboard.js
Additional List

Be styled with CSS. Examples:

Bootstrap
Bulma
Foundation

Access at least two remote APIs. Examples:

TheCatAPI
DogCEO
API List - n0shake/Public-APIs
API List - public-apis
Note that loading a JavaScript or CSS library from a CDN does not fulfill this requirement.
Have a README.md file written using Markdown with at least the following:

Explanation of what the project is / what it does.
What technologies you used.
Screenshots of your project.


List of team members.


Be deployed online and publicly accessible. Examples:

Netlify
Amazon S3
Google Cloud
Surge
Vercel
Note: You do not need to purchase a domain name for your project.


Code must follow some organization scheme.

Everything cannot be in one super long file.
Break different parts of the code into different files / modules.
Good variable names
Good comments
Optional: Consider using a build system with npm scripts, browserify, or webpack
Workflow Requirements

Teams will be groups of 3-4 students and assigned by instructors.

Create one GitHub repo and add all group members as collaborators.

Collaborate using Pull Requests (PRs):

No one should commit to the master branch directly.
Every PR should be reviewed and approved by at least one team member (not the person who originated the PR).
PRs should not be merged by the person who opened it (no self-merging).
See below for suggested PR rejection criteria
Project features and bugs must be tracked using a scrum-like system:

Every PR should be associated with a GitHub Issue (or similar).
Consider using a tool like GitHub Project Board or Trello.
Every class day teams will have a "stand up meeting" with a TA or Instructor.
Suggested PR Rejection Criteria

It's ok to reject a PR or have a PR rejected - that is what the PR process is for! Remember if your PR is rejected that doesn't mean you are a bad person and stink at life. It just means that your teammate(s) see something that could be improved. The PR process is more about sharing knowledge than "you did something wrong".

Any of the following are valid reasons to reject a PR:

Does not fulfill feature (i.e. if the feature it doesn't work correctly or at all)
Breaks other feature (i.e. make sure existing features still work)
Does not follow team coding style / standards (i.e. if you use prettier or ESLint, make sure you all have the same settings)
Too much to review / large code diff (i.e. should be broken up into smaller PRs)
Code in the PR does not match up with commit message (i.e. if it contains work other than that which the task requires)
Commit message is vague (i.e. 'please work' is not a good commit message)
